2. Write a Program for the first 10 numbers of Fibonacci series.

public class Main
{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	    
	    System.out.print("Here are the first 10 fibinocci numbers: 0, 1");
		// a and b are to store first two fibinocci numbers and c is to calculate third using previous two numbers
		int a = 0, b = 1, c, count = 2;
		// till the count is 10 we iterate so that we get 10 numbers
		while(count < 10)
		{
		    c = a + b;
		    System.out.print(", "+c);
		    a=b;
		    b=c;
		    count++;
		}
	}
}
